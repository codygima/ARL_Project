# ARL_Project

This repository goes over the projects that I have worked on during the ARL Internship. My projects are mainly centered around my learning of Front-End Development Frameworks at ARL, specifically React frameworks (for most of my projects). In this repository, I have included links to my other repositories where you can look at my projects individually.
